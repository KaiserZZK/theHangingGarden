----About The Hanging Garden----

What do I hope to achieve? What will be the core takeaway? 
The current way we interact with technology is constraining: our gestures are dictated by programmed languages of mobile APPs: tap, double tap, drag, press…
Taking that as the premise, The Hanging Garden (THG) creates a generative ecosystem, where each individual’s unique gesture sows the seed for a digital biodiversity.
We are all co-creators with technology, not just users whose behaviors are tamed by technology; I hope by interacting with THG, we can all envision a future with more organic human-machine interaction.

What are the interactive components?
Touch: 
Gesture–initial positioning of fingers on touchscreen
Movement–path of arm movement dragged across the screen
